## Who am I?

I'm just a normal student but passinated about coding, believing programming is one of the most robust and powerful weapon to recoin this world. TotoroQ is the pseudonym I used most for profiles related to programming.

## What's the website for?

This website is built for the apps I have created or will be created. It's not exactly a personal blog for me. The name of this website, DEX Studio, is made by the abbreviations of three words, design, efficiency and experience, which are basically my personal defination of the modern apps.
